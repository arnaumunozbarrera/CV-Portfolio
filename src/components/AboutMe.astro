    I started programming in high school with basic codes about prime numbers. Over the years, I have delved into various programming languages and technologies. My passion for coding has only grown stronger with time. Currently, I am <strong>expanding my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development</strong>. I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills.
